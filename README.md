# Natural-Disasters

This project takes a look at the historical trends of natural disasters, how they've noticeable increased and worsened over time, and how global warming plays a part in it. We looked at data spanning from 1900 - 2023 and focused on both global and national disasters. The data I'm including is for my portion of the project which was to take a look at the number of deaths regarding these disasters, including the top 2 disasters - Flooding and Extreme Temperature. Below is the published Tableau works for each of our parts:
